4. Make sure you have the necessary python libraries installed (list is below)
5. Open program files in VS Code, and make sure the correct python interpreter for your version is selected
6. Run the file called SolarSystemSim.py
7. Enjoy! (and read the keybinds)

List of python libraries needed for this program:
1. pygame (if pygame doesn't work, install pygame-ce for newer versions of python)
2. math
3. numpy
